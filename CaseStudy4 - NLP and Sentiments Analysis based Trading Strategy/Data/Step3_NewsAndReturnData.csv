JPM|Technicians call it filling the gap, but whatever it is, it's not pretty. JPMorgan (JPM -1.8%) gives up just about all of a 6% surge following its earnings report last Friday. The bank is clearly well-capitalized and the CIO loss but a blip, but in a slow-economy, flattish yield curve environment, where will underlying earnings growth come from?|2012-07-19|-0.031411031418792756|27.5
GOOG|Google (GOOG +2.9%) is rallying ahead of this afternoon's Q2 report - eBay's results could be helping, given much of Google's search ad revenue is tied to e-commerce activity. Search ad prices will be in focus, following two quarters of significant declines. Two wild cards that could work in Google's favor: mobile queries are soaring, and ad clicks are surging as a % of total search clicks, thanks to Google's efforts to promote them. Some are worried about Euro and forex exposure. (previous)|2012-07-19|0.058108274520131786|295.42
GOOG|Unlike Microsoft, Google (GOOG +3.1%) is holding onto its post-earnings gains. The Street is taking heart in strong Y/Y paid click growth and a halt to recent ad price declines. However, some are still worried ad prices remain well below year-ago levels, and wish Google provided details about Motorola's full-quarter performance. Deutsche sees rising mobile ad prices and higher shopping-related mobile search activity giving Google a 2H lift. (transcript)|2012-07-20|0.05880239775660767|304.27
